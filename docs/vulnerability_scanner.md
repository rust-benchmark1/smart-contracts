# Rust Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanner

This tool scans Rust smart contract code for potential security vulnerabilities, focusing on common issues in blockchain platforms like Solana, NEAR, and CosmWasm.

## Features

- Static code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities
- Platform-specific scanning for Solana, NEAR, and more
- Security checklist generation
- Detailed reporting of findings

## Usage

### Scanning a Project

```bash
cargo run --bin vuln_scanner -- scan --path /path/to/your/project --platform solana
```

For a more detailed report:

```bash
cargo run --bin vuln_scanner -- scan --path /path/to/your/project --platform solana --detailed
```

### Generating a Security Checklist

```bash
cargo run --bin vuln_scanner -- checklist --platform solana --output checklist.md
```

## Supported Vulnerability Types

The scanner checks for multiple vulnerability categories, including:

1. **Reentrancy vulnerabilities**
2. **Integer overflow/underflow**
3. **Missing ownership checks**
4. **Access control issues**
5. **Unchecked return values**
6. **And more...**

## Limitations

- This is a static analysis tool that may produce false positives
- It's designed as an aid for auditors, not a replacement for manual code review
- Some complex vulnerabilities may not be detected

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add new vulnerability patterns:

1. Edit the `create_vulnerability_patterns()` function in `vuln_scanner.rs`
2. Add appropriate regex patterns and descriptions
3. Submit a pull request
