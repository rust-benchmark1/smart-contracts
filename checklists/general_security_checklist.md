# Rust Smart Contract Security Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for auditing Rust-based smart contracts across different blockchain platforms.

## General Rust Smart Contract Security

### 1. Type Safety and Memory Management

- [ ] Ensure proper bounds checking on arrays and vectors
- [ ] Check for potential integer overflow/underflow
- [ ] Verify safe handling of references and borrows
- [ ] Check for proper error handling (avoid panics)
- [ ] Verify that unsafe code blocks, if any, are properly justified and reviewed

### 2. Input Validation

- [ ] Validate all function parameters against expected ranges
- [ ] Check for deserialization vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify that user-provided data is sanitized before use
- [ ] Ensure proper validation of external contract calls

### 3. Access Control

- [ ] Verify all privileged functions have appropriate access controls
- [ ] Check for proper implementation of ownership patterns
- [ ] Validate role-based access control mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure state-changing functions have proper authorization

### 4. State Management

- [ ] Verify consistent state updates (checks-effects-interactions pattern)
- [ ] Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure atomic state updates
- [ ] Verify logical consistency of state transitions

### 5. Asset Management

- [ ] Validate all fund transfers
- [ ] Check for proper balance accounting
- [ ] Verify fee calculations and distributions
- [ ] Check for potential double-spending

## Solana-Specific Security Checks

### 1. Account Validation

- [ ] Verify ownership checks for all accounts
- [ ] Validate Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) with proper seeds and bump
- [ ] Check account type validation
- [ ] Ensure account data size validation

### 2. Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) Security

- [ ] Verify proper handling of CPIs
- [ ] Check for potential reentrancy through CPIs
- [ ] Validate signer privileges in CPIs
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for CPI results

### 3. Compute Budget

- [ ] Check for potential compute budget exhaustion
- [ ] Verify efficient data access patterns
- [ ] Validate transaction size limitations

## NEAR-Specific Security Checks

### 1. Cross-Contract Calls

- [ ] Verify proper callback handling
- [ ] Check for potential reentrancy through callbacks
- [ ] Validate proper error handling in callbacks

### 2. Storage Management

- [ ] Verify efficient storage usage
- [ ] Check for storage staking requirements
- [ ] Validate storage permission controls

### 3. Gas Efficiency

- [ ] Check for potential gas exhaustion
- [ ] Verify efficient data structures for gas optimization

## CosmWasm-Specific Security Checks

### 1. Message Passing

- [ ] Verify proper message handling
- [ ] Check for potential message manipulation

### 2. Contract Migration

- [ ] Validate upgrade mechanisms
- [ ] Check for proper state migration

## Audit Preparation Checklist

### 1. Documentation

- [ ] Verify comprehensive documentation of contract functionality
- [ ] Check for clear explanations of privileged roles
- [ ] Ensure expected behaviors are well-documented

### 2. Testing

- [ ] Verify unit test coverage
- [ ] Check for integration tests
- [ ] Validate fuzz testing if applicable
- [ ] Ensure edge cases are tested

### 3. Environment

- [ ] Validate dependency versions
- [ ] Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Verify build reproducibility
